      <h2>External Scripts</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Most of the time, your JavaScript will be written in a separate file,
        like you do with CSS. Up until this point we've been using embedded
        script tags, as it is better for prototyping.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are several benefits to having external script files:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The browser can cache a copy of the script, so if many pages on your
          site need to use it the browser only downloads it once.
        </li>
        <li>It can keep your HTML much cleaner and easier to read.</li>
        <li>
          Over time, code is much more maintainable if it is not spread out
          across little files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Let's create a script file in the <code>day1/resources/</code> folder.
        Then add it using a script element.
      </p>

      <h3>IMPORTANT: Order of execution</h3>
      <p>
        It is important that our JavaScript runs AFTER our HTML has been fully
        processed by the browser. To make sure that happens we have 2 choices:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the <code>script</code> element at the bottom of our document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the <code>defer</code> attribute to tell the browser "wait until
          the rest of the page is loaded, before you load this file."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Using a defer attribute looks like this:</p>
      <code>&lt;script defer src=&quot;../resources/1-6_DONE.js&quot; /&gt;
      </code>
      <p>
        So long as you use that, you can add your scripts in the
        <code>head</code> of your HTML with no issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Sloppy vs. Strict Modes of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        "Old School" JavaScript used to allow developers to write code that was
        shall we say more <i>"loosey goosey"</i>. Modern JavaScript introduced a
        newer "strict mode" which can help developers in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Catches errors that in older versions of JavaScript would "silently
          fail"
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourages the developers through more precise error messages to write
          better code
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevents developers from using certain keywords that are reserved for
          future versions of JavaScript
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To enable strict mode in your external JavaScript files, add
        <code>"use strict";</code> to the top of your script file.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditional Logic, and Control Flow</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We need to write code <i>defensively</i>, because we need to account for
        all the things the user might do. To do that, we have to think about
        control flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets go back to our 1-3 and 1-4 example with the
        <code>prompt()</code> method. We learned through our dev tools that
        depending on how the user fills out (or does not fill out) the prompt,
        different values are <i>returned</i> to our code. We can end up with a
        string that contains characters(<code>"Bob"</code>), an empty string
        (<code>""</code>), or <code>null</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to imagine my code as water flowing down stream, and depending on
        certain <i>conditions</i> different gates will open or close, changing
        the flow of the water.
      </p>
      <p>That, in essence is conditional logic.</p>
      <p>
        Lets add some conditional logic, so that we only change the text when
        the user supplies us with a very specific name, "Bob".
      </p>
      <h3>Hi, <span id="name">No-Name</span>!</h3>
      <img src="../resources/conditionals.excalidraw.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Using conditionals, we control what code is executed and which isn't,
        depending on the state of our application and behavior of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get the hang of that, then you are basically controlling where electrons
        flow using your mind, which is pretty rad.
