  // The simplest way to add JavaScript to a web page is to use the <script> tag.

  // You will want to add your <script> tags to the bottom of your <body> tag. Why?

  // JavaScript BASIC SYNTAX:

  // 1. Comments
  // Single line comment

  /*
        Multi-line
        comment
  */

  // You are probably already familiar with this from working in HTML and CSS.
  // Note that comments are public facing, so don't put any sensitive information in them.

  // 2. Semi Colons
  // In JavaScript, semi colons are used to tell the computer when you have finished a line of code.
  // It is not required, as computers are smarter than they used to be at figuring out where a line ends...
  // but it is good practice to use them.

  // 3. Conventions
  // There are a few conventions that you should follow when writing JavaScript.
  // Most programmers use something called 'camelCase' when naming variables.
  // and most built-in tools you use in JavaScript will be written in camelCase.
  // This means that the first word is lowercase, and every word after that is capitalized.
  // For example: myVariableName

  // HELLO WORLD EXAMPLE:
  alert("Hello world");
</script>
