        The fun part about JavaScript, is you never really know the value of
        your variable, until something breaks!
      </p>
      <p>
        Take this code for example, we are trying to change the background color
        of a box from red to blue again, but it isn't working.
      </p>
      <script>
        let box = document.querySelector(".box");
        box.styles.backgroundColor = "blue";
      </script>
      <p>
        From the browser alone, it doesn't look like anything has gone wrong.
        Let's open up the developer tools and see what's going on.

        Translating these errors back into english can be a challenge at first..
        Any guesses?

        I recommend always having your console open when you are working on a
        project.

      <h2>Logging</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        You can also add your own messages to the console, using
        <code>console.log()</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very helpful tool for debugging, as well as getting a better
        understanding of how your code is flowing.

      <p>Lets reuse our prompt example from 1-3, but add logging.</p>
      <h3>Hi, <span id="name">No-Name!</span></h3>
      <script>
        // 1. Create a variable, but don't assign a value yet
        let name;
        console.log("name variable value is: ", name);
        // 2. Gather name from user, uncomment the line below
        // name = prompt("What is your name?");
        console.log("New name variable value is: ", name);
        // 3. Get span by its ID using the document.getElementById method
        let nameElem = document.getElementById("name");
        // 4. Set the innerText property of the span to the name value we gathered from the user
        console.log("nameElem.innerText value is: ", nameElem.innerText);
        nameElem.innerText = name;
        console.log("nameElem.innerText value is now: ", nameElem.innerText);
