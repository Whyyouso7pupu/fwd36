      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The basics of web development is the combination of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. HTML is the structure of the page, CSS is the
        styling/presentation, and JavaScript is the behavior layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is what makes websites dynamic and interactive. Meaning we
        can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Change the content of the page based on user input or other events
        </li>
        <li>Create dynamic animations</li>
        <li>Validate forms/input from the user</li>
        <li>Create browser based video games</li>
        <li>
          Create full fledged web applications (like Google Docs, Gmail, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some more details on the language:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          JavaScript was originally called "LiveScript" and was written in 10
          days
        </li>
        <li>
          It is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to specify whether
          your variables are holding a string, or a number, etc. The language
          does it for you.
        </li>
        <li>Was originally only intended to run on the clients browser</li>
        <li>Now runs everywhere, for better or worse</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Limitations of JavaScript</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        When JavaScript is running on a client's browser, it cannot access the
        user's file system, it also cannot reach into other webpages the user
        may have open.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript CAN modify the local computers file system when running
        inside Node.JS, but that is outside the scope of this course.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Versions of JavaScript</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        JavaScript has gone through many iterations, with new features and
        syntax being brought in over time. JavaScript is sometimes referred to
        as ECMAScript, or certain versions of JavaScript may be referred to
        specifically, for example ES6, ES7, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will go over some of these differences as we get further into the
        course.
