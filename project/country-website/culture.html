            <h2>Wabi-Sabi</h2>
            <p>
              In traditional Japanese aesthetics, wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a world
              view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection.
              The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of appreciating beauty
              that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete" in nature. It is
              prevalent in many forms of Japanese art.

            <p>
              Omotenashi (Japanese: おもてなし, 御持成) is a Japanese expression
              that roughly describes concepts of hospitality as well as
              mindfulness. The term developed particularly around the roles of
              the host at a Japanese tea ceremony. The term gained increased
              awareness internationally through the 2020 Summer Olympics in
              Tokyo.

            <h2>Media</h2>
            <p>
              Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.
              Ishirō Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and
              spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the
              longest-running film franchise in history. Japanese comics, known
              as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become
              popular worldwide. A large number of manga series have become some
              of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the
              American comics industry. Japanese animated films and television
              series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga
              and have become highly popular internationally.
